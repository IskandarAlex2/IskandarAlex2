**Iskyverse** (pronounced Is-ky-verse) is a universe of **IskandarAlex2's** creations. It consists of multiple subuniverses like [The 4Tris](https://wiki.saihex.com/wiki/The4Tris).
In Iskyverse any entities that can hop universes can freely hop to other subuniverses under Iskyverse.

**Iskyverse** started alongside [The 4Tris](https://wiki.saihex.com/wiki/The4Tris) making [The 4Tris](https://wiki.saihex.com/wiki/The4Tris) as the icon and center of **Iskyverse**. This impacts other subuniverse influences to 
[The 4Tris](https://wiki.saihex.com/wiki/The4Tris) as being the first original subuniverse within **Iskyverse**.

As of July 1st, 2024, the icon for Iskyverse is the [character category](https://wiki.saihex.com/wiki/The4Tris/category/Characters) icon for [The 4Tris wiki](https://wiki.saihex.com/wiki/The4Tris).

## Iskyverse Unit
The Iskyverse scale to real life isn't equal due to complications during the creation of said scale with current models. So, the Iskyverse Unit (Abbreviated as **IU**) has the following ratios.

Fun fact, 10 feet is the height of Sairo from head to foot excluding ears as she is one of the first persistent models in Iskyverse resulting in her being on the scale of IU.
IU is equal to Blender meter on default setting by [Blender 4.0](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/4-0/)

ratio for metric **Iskyverse Unit (IU) : Centimeter**
\[
1 : \frac{6096}{293}
\]

Where for the Americans you may use **IU : Feet**
\[
14.65 : 10
\]
